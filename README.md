Data Wrangling for WeRateDogs twitter account

This folder contains the files for the Data Wrangling project in Udacity Data Analyst Nano Degree .

In this project I Wrangle and Analyze a Twitter data of WeRateDogs.

The goal of the project: Gathering and combining multiple datasets of WeRateDogs from Twitter to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information. Additional gathering using the Twitter API, then programmatically assessing and cleaning was required for great analyses and visualizations.
